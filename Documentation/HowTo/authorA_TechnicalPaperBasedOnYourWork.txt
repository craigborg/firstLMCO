As you author your paper, consider these questions:

Technical Content
Are all major factors considered (correctness of theory, validity of the reasoning used, apparent understanding and grasp of subject, etc.) and a reasonably accurate evaluation of these facts made?

Originality
Is the paper just a compilation of standard textbook information, or does the paper show independence of thinking or fresh approach to the subject? Is the subject a well-worn one, or does the choice and treatment of it show some imagination?

Practical Application
Does you reach conclusions or recommendations that are feasible and practical for use, or do you merely lead the audience into further difficult or insoluble questions?

Style and Form
Is the paper written in commendable English and does it present the material clearly and in the good, acceptable form for technical papers?
