%% Demo Script
% This template serves as an example of a demo that may help reduce ramp up
% time, for other AEs or anyone learning the content, e.g. customer. I 
% believe if we organize, not all, but some of our primary or "core" demos 
% in a specific way, they will be easier to understand and use. Much like 
% most cars have the turn signal control on the left side of the steering 
% wheel, if we all put similar files or functions in familar places, a new 
% user of a demo will, on average, be able to ramp up faster and spend more
% time on the technical content or offering improvements.
% 
%% Introduction to this template
%
% The template includes an example file demoScript.m in the Navigation 
% folder that is published as an html using the publish command (which you 
% are now reading) to provide documentation and links to files or functions
% that need to run during the demo. 
% 
% I have found other useful ways to help other AEs navigate demos, 
% including a Word document saved as an html, or straight html code.
% 
% Some AEs prefer using the Simulink Project shortcuts but have mentioned 
% additional documentation may be needed to assist new users of your demo 
% in this case.
% 
% Craig Borghesani wrote a series of scripts that publishes a MATLAB file 
% without having to restrict yourself to the syntax requirements of the 
% publish command. Check out the file script2html.m, and related files, in 
% the Navigation\Script2html folder for more info. 
%

%% Examples if this is new
%
% * <matlab:runThis; Highlight this link> but don't highlight this (click
% on "Highlight this link" to run "runTask1.m"; note the MATLAB code to be
% executed in the lower left hand corner of the MATLAB window.)
% * <matlab:winopen('demoPresentation.pptx') Open the powerpoint> and talk
% through some slides
% * Write an equation: $F=m*a$
% * <matlab:open_system('f14'); Open a model>
% * Open subsystems, run models, plot data, etc.
% * <matlab:winopen('demoPresentation.pptx') Open the
% powerpoint> from where you left off
%
%% Introduction to the template's structure
% This template uses the following standard folder structure:
% 
% This template attempts to introduce a standard folder structure (ref: 
% Greg Wolff) with following intent:
% 
% Common - Files common to multiple demos, e.g. a DC Motor demo used in 
% both ballTracking and RobotArm or as included here a test script and data
% to test connectivity to the REFPROP database.
% 
% Component - Files related to each component of the demo with one subfolder 
% for each component, e.g. one folder, called CAD, for all the CAD files 
% for the demo, or another folder, called Libraries, for all the +Libraries
% needed to build your Simscape components for the demo. The folder 
% structure within the Component folder will vary widely. The intent is to 
% make it easy for someone new to the demo to pick it up quickly and reduce
% the amount of time the owner spends fielding questions on his/her demo.
% 
% Documentation - Any documentation related to the demo, e.g. a readMe.txt,
% a requirements document for the demo, or PDFs or images that show how to 
% setup hardware. If a video of the owner or collaborator walking through 
% some portion of the demo could be helpful to other MathWorkers, the 
% template also includes a Videos folder here.
% 
% Navigation - Files needed to navigate the demo. For CDA, it might be a 
% published MATLAB file. For LTC or SPC, it might be a MATLAB file to run 
% by section or a MATLAB file that calls each file in the Task folder. This
% template includes demoScript.m which is published and opened when you 
% open the project by projectStartup.m and openHTML.m.
% 
% Presentation - Files you need when presenting the demo. The template 
% includes a folder for any and all powerpoints and a video. This video 
% could be a video of the hardware in action, in case it isn't working when
% you need it to or it could be a video that presents the demo to a customer
% in a short time span. One of these videos could eventually become a 
% webinar online, but the concept is that videos in this folder are meant 
% to be customer facing.
% 
% Project - Files related to the management of the project. This template 
% contains startup and shutdown scripts and functions related to the 
% management of the MATLAB path.
% 
% Task - Files related to each task to be accomplished during the demo, 
% e.g. one MATLAB file for each task or one folder containing the files 
% needed to perform that task
% 
% Utility - Files that may be used throughout the demo. This template
% includes:
%
% * convertToSLX: to convert all .mdl files in the project to .slx
% * convertFromOldVersion: to convert all models from older versions to the
% current verion
% * getRootFolder: puts the current root folder in the workspace
% * slstripcomments: strips comments from a MATLAB file (Peter Acklam)
% * requiredFiles: Returns a complete list, augmented with filenames called
% by I/O functions, required to run the program files specified by files. 
% (Brett Shoelson)
% 
% Work - Temporary files that can be deleted between each demonstration. 
% Don't worry. Nowhere in the template are these files deleted, but you 
% could specify something like that in projectShutdown.m
